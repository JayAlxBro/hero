        <h1>Our Story</h1>
        <h2>What HERO is about</h2>
        <p>A great new type of fast food that wants to introduce more creative healthier food options for those willing to try something new and to help those who are starting a healthier lifestyle.</p>

        <h2>Our History</h2>
        <p>I have worked as an Early Childhood English teacher, teaching kids in South Korea the English Language which included fun classes such as cooking. I introduced recipes that gave children more creative ways to eat healthy food. Instead of eating an orange, we would turn our orange into pumpkins, or instead of eating an apple, we made our apples into edible teeth. These are just a few of the fun and creative ways to introduce healthier food options to kids and adults.
        </p>

        <p>Our new HERO restaurant includes these fun and creative snacks, along with other healthy foods such as fresh juices, smoothies and different salad ideas.</p>

        <h3>Cauliflower Crust Pizza</h3>
        <p>Cauliflower Crusted Pizza with your choice of sausage, pepperoni, and cheese. You can also add vegetables of your choice.</p>

        <h3>Korean Shabu Shabu</h3>
        <p>Korean Shabu Shabu is a soup with vegetables that include mushrooms, enoki mushrooms, cabbage and thinly sliced beef. It is served with a side of rice and seaweed sheets.</p>
