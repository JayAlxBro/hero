        <h2 class="hero-about-heading">What HERO is about</h2>

        <p class="hero-about-heading-content">A great new type of fast food that wants to introduce more creative healthier food options for those willing to try something new and to help those who are starting a healthier lifestyle.</p>


        <h2 class="hero-about-history">Our History</h2>
        <p class="hero-about-history-content">Our founder worked as an Early Childhood English teacher, teaching kids in South Korea the English Language, which included fun classes such as cooking. She introduced recipes that gave children more creative ways to eat healthy food. Instead of eating an orange, they would turn the oranges into pumpkins, or instead of eating an apple, they made the apples into edible teeth. These were just a few of the fun and creative ways to introduce healthier food options to kids and adults.
        </p>

        <p class="hero-about-new-para">Our new HERO restaurant includes these fun and creative snacks, along with other healthy foods such as fresh juices, smoothies and different salad ideas.</p>
